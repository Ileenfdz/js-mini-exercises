## Count the Monkeys!

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

For example:

monkeyCount(10) // --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
monkeyCount(1) // --> [1]

## Count of positives / sum of negatives

Given an array of integers.

Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.

If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.

Example
For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], you should return [10, -65].
